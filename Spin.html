1990-1995: Creation and Launch of Java
1990: Java’s story begins with a project called The Green Project initiated by James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton at Sun Microsystems. The goal was to create a language for consumer electronics, like televisions and set-top boxes.

1991: The team, later known as the Green Team, developed a language called Oak (named after an oak tree outside Gosling’s office). Oak was initially designed for embedded systems, but the project did not gain traction in the consumer electronics industry.

1995: Oak was renamed to Java, inspired by Java coffee (a reference to coffee consumed during development). This year marks the official launch of Java, with Sun Microsystems releasing Java 1.0. The goal was to create a platform-independent language, meaning Java programs could run on any device that supported a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

May 23, 1995: Sun Microsystems announced the release of Java with the slogan "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA), emphasizing its platform independence.
1996-1999: Rise to Popularity
1996: Sun Microsystems released Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.0. This was the first stable version of Java, which included essential libraries and tools for developing Java applications. Java quickly gained popularity for its portability, object-oriented programming model, and versatility.

1997: Java 1.1 was released. This version introduced new features like inner classes, JavaBeans, and JDBC (Java Database Connectivity). The rise of Java applets also began, allowing dynamic content in web browsers.

1998: The release of Java 2 Platform (also known as JDK 1.2) marked a major turning point. Java was split into three editions:

Java Standard Edition (J2SE): For desktop and server applications.
Java Enterprise Edition (J2EE): For large-scale, distributed enterprise applications.
Java Micro Edition (J2ME): For mobile devices and embedded systems.
1999: The Java Community Process (JCP) was established, allowing third parties to participate in the development of Java specifications, ensuring its evolution as an open standard.

2000-2009: Enterprise and Mobile Growth
2000: The Java 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE) 1.3 was released, becoming a standard for building enterprise-level applications. It introduced Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) 2.0 and enhanced support for web services.

2004: Java 5.0 (formerly known as Java 1.5) was released. This version introduced major language enhancements such as:

Generics
Enhanced for loop (foreach loop)
Enumerated types
Metadata annotations
Varargs
2006: Sun Microsystems made Java open source by releasing most of the Java Virtual Machine and other components under the GNU General Public License (GPL).

2009: Oracle Corporation announced its acquisition of Sun Microsystems, which would be completed in 2010. This marked a significant shift in the stewardship of Java.

2010-Present: Java Under Oracle and Beyond
2010: Oracle officially took over the development of Java after acquiring Sun Microsystems. Oracle's stewardship raised concerns in the developer community about the future direction of the language, but Oracle continued to release regular updates.

2011: Java 7 was released by Oracle, marking the first major release under Oracle's management. This version introduced key features such as:

Try-with-resources
The diamond operator
NIO.2 (enhanced file I/O)
2014: Java 8 was released, introducing significant updates to the language, including:

Lambda expressions: Enabling functional-style programming.
The Stream API: Facilitating bulk operations on collections.
A new date and time API.
Default methods in interfaces.
2017: Java 9 introduced the long-awaited module system (Project Jigsaw), allowing for better modularization of applications. It also featured improvements to the JVM and garbage collection.

2018: Oracle announced a new release cadence for Java, aiming for a new release every six months. Java 10 and Java 11 were released this year. Java 11 was a Long-Term Support (LTS) release, marking Oracle’s new support model. This release added enhancements like local-variable syntax for lambda expressions and HTTP Client API.

2021: Java 17 was released as the next LTS version after Java 11. Key improvements included enhanced pattern matching, sealed classes, and text blocks.

2023: Java 20 continued to refine language features and performance, particularly around garbage collection, JIT compilation, and native memory management.
